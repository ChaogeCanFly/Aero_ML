# Aero_ML: An aeroacoustic Machine Learning Repository
This machine learning project's goal is to take raw audio data from an anechoic 
Wind Tunnel and using machine learning/deep learning methods, optain data from the noise 
of a standard airfoil, and noise from the walls of the wind tunnel which will
prepoccessed and fed to a ML architecture where the output of the model will
(in theory) be able to properly identify if a given microphone signal has evidence
of learned non-airfoild noises. 

Ultimately, this is meant to be a data cleaning tool for incoming acoustic data
that is more generalizable, and requires less custom editing, and more analysis 
of results!
